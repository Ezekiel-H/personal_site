My name is Zeke and I work in fraud and from New Zealand based in Amsterdam. I am interested in data, history, politics and the enviroment. Totaly an R and Shiny nerd but spend most of my time working in Python. 

Mostly this site is an excuse to write some Shiny apps and as a place potential rectuiters can see that I have enough ability to run ```blogdown::build_site()``` I am excited to learn how I can help with charitable or open source projects especially focused on sustainability and enviromental causes, please reach out to kiaora@ezekiel.nz



```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addMarkers(lat=52.3667, lng=4.8946, popup="Zekes in Amsterdam") 


```
