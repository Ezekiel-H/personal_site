[{"content":"A project I am proud of is rolling out a strategy to send fraud rejected traffic to 3DS unlocking 40+ million in benefit from otherwise declined good bookers. Why am I proud of this, well it worked. Until it didn\u0026rsquo;t. Righting the ship took made the project more interesting.\nAlso similar to how you work at Vend this project was conceived and driven between myself and an engineering lead.\nAgenda So what are we going to talk about today?\n Background, what is fraud? what is the product vision? Why TARR, why now? Exploring the idea, using GOAL Roll out and delegation. Unforeseen risks righting the ship Reflections  Background and what is fraud? Given you have given me up to an hour to present Ive taken the liberty to take my time and show you how to commit fraud.\n what is fraud la la\n So now we know how to commit fraud what is it I do and \u0026ldquo;why does this matter\u0026rdquo;\n 100s of millions at risk a year. Solution stop fraud by stopping all payments\u0026hellip; so the ongoing challenge is balancing fraud risk while approving good customers. The team is then tasked with constantly trying to move the needle on the cost of fraud metric, while products, markets and strategy moves.    TARR So how can you move the needle along, improve good traffic being accepted or block more fraud. Looking across the payment flow we see oppotunities and risks.\n We can improve the ML model, improve features, outsource a 3rd party liability shift after decline. Continuous improvement aside, how do we come up with creative (read good) ideas? Staying involved in what matters, discussions with vendors, colleges and the business, watching the movements of the industry and competitors.\nWeekly discussions across internal payments teams, platform, accommodations operations allows us to better understand where we are what blockers are there and have been moved.\nSo where were we?\n COVID had lowered traffic substantially (outside impact) Riskified (our vendor) was being pushed to preform better. Our model was preformant and gains slower (continuous improvement) Operations had limited ability to find golden features. Platform had recently migrated all 3DS SCA flows allowing for better visibility  This Last point was the basis for trying out a new approach to unlock the good customers in declined. 3DS was historically a black box SCA improved the infrastructure for visibility. We had stable fraud rates and due to COVID the risk was higher of rejecting good traffic.\nWe considered what if we just sent all the rejected traffic to 3DS? Terrible idea. but could we make it a good one.\n   TARR using the GAME structure.   Goal Release a new pipeline to unlock customers otherwise rejected for fraud.\n  Action Construct and monitor an ability to send rejected customers to 3DS.\n Ensure 3DS flow was being triggered Ensure there was an opt out option Appropriate flags Monitoring ongoing    Metrics What are the metrics that indicate users are taking Actions to align with Goals\n  Evaluate Evaluate if the metric could be a false positive indicator\n  Mapping stakeholders Who you worked with and how to find the best solution (collaboration)\nGetting buy in How you involved the rest of the company and ensured their buy in\nOngoing relationships with each of the various teams\n Roll out and delegation. Engaging in consus the project built out a new flow for traffic, bespoke monitoring and mitigation.\n Incremental Cycle review, early coms, contious updates. 5% to 10%  then moving to a stakeholder as the senior analyst took over monitoring and implimentation and communication with the dev to update the flows.\nLeveraging learnings into further work on vendor management and foundational work for other products.\nUnforeseen risks righting the ship 4 - 6 weeks later. Early issues began to emerge. Metric xyz increased. The analyst investigating the situation explained the issue. Fraud was being sent to 3DS yes. But it was sometimes enrolled while shopping passing the liability back to us.\nGraph here on\n all data is dummy  Short term scale back from 50% to 5% with specific behavioural pattern blocked\n  No operational ability to mitigate over time\n  Payments track did not have this feature available and was likely a 6 week ask.\n  Discussions quickly upward to send early signal that project might be killed.\n  Bridged discussion with our PSP on solution, able to buy off the shelf a a solution that can be implimented on the specific call.\n  Righting the ship\n  Under 1 week turn around on off shelf solution. Re trigger up to 50% scale and monitor.\n  Reflections  Outside normal analyst flow\nTARR at vend?? Well Vend is not the merchant on record, so maybe not a good idea, but your customers care.\nWhat I hope this project highlights that I do think is impactful at Vend.\n Developing new ideas ontop of existing frameworks point point  A final point is maybe where is Vend going? When you consider the likes of Booking, Uber, Amazon all applying for payment service licenses the impact of owning that payment flow has immense benfits at scale.\nSo where is Vend going? One big risk I see is Stripe they have more data.\n","permalink":"http://ezekiel.nz/presentation/tarr/","summary":"A project I am proud of is rolling out a strategy to send fraud rejected traffic to 3DS unlocking 40+ million in benefit from otherwise declined good bookers.

Using this I was able to build and maintain the site using mostly R, GIT and a good grasp of how to google css/html.\nI thought I would detail a step by step how to follow this to create a barebones copy and how to host it (for free) on GITHUB\u0026rsquo;s pages\nWhy do this So couple things firstly why? In the modern age an online presence is more of a conclusion than an option so it\u0026rsquo;s importanat to control the narrative. Sure you can use Medium or LinkdIn or an off the shelf website build but fuck that, thats lame.\nA second consideration is why GIT and blogdown, well first off its free and secondly the blogdown structure is designed mobile first, SEO optimised and with the option to write in RMD lets you move seamlessly between code (Not just R) and text. I personally enjoy playing with data and code and R is my first love so to speak so its nice to combine the two.\nDisclamir If you are happy to work it out for yourself there is a very detailed guide in the docs https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html\nOverview  This guide will show step by step how to set up a blogdown site on GIT. Setting up R Setting up GIT Picking a theme Local to Production cycle  Setting up R My folder path is ~R/ so creating a new folder example_ezekiel.nz on ~/R/example_ezekiel.nz and creating a fresh project in the folder, R and install the packages blogdown.\ninstall.packages('blogdown') To quote Yihis \u0026lsquo;Since blogdown is based on the static site generator Hugo (https://gohugo.io), you also need to install Hugo. There is a helper function in blogdown to download and install it automatically on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux):'\nblogdown::install_hugo() Then simply\nblogdown::new_site() If you are getting an error check that your wd is on your folder path in my example ~R/example_ezekiel.nz/ and that the folder is empty.\nsetwd(\u0026quot;C:/Users/Ezekiel/Desktop/R/example_ezekiel.nz/\u0026quot;) I was getting some wild errors turns out that my R was still on version 3.30 and some packages were failing. Guess 2016 is too long between personal package updates.\nAssuming its all ok you should get the following\n\u0026gt; Want to serve and preview the site now? (y/n) Hit y and you will be set with the basic site and template on your local host. So now looking in my folder I have the following.\ncontent/ layouts/ R/ reasources/ static/ themes/ .Rprofile config.yaml index.Rmd netlify.toml I can use the following commands to see the blogdown default site.\nblogdown::build_site() blogdown::serve_site() This should render down a new folder /public which we will use as part of the deployment flow. The way I would advise is to create a folder /docs and copy the public folder across after rendering the build.\nAwesome simple as that. So now on to GIT.\nGIT Following the GIT pages guide you need to sign up for an account and create a repo. The one for this site is called personal_site as an example but I will continue with the example_ezekiel.nz repo.\nGo to the folder where you want to store your project, and initiate the repo with\ngit init git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit\u0026quot; git remote add origin git@github.com:Ezekiel-H/example_ezekiel git push -u origin master Now in the settings change the source to docs/\nAdjust the source to /docs and you should be done now at https://ezekiel-h.github.io/example_ezekiel.nz/ you should have a functional site.\n","permalink":"http://ezekiel.nz/post/using-r-and-git-to-host-a-pesonal-site/","summary":"When I can I try to use R so when looking to put a personal site together a few years back I thought it was a good time to explore the blogdown package.

This presents an interesting question does the market balance the FX across currencies in real time? If not there would be room for arbitrage and a real ability to make money transferring between currencies using BTC markets.\nThis quick analysis will look to see if it is theoretically possible to make money changing NZD for BTC then to GBP and back to NZD via a BTC exchange. Firstly lets look at the price of bitcoin relative to GBP and NZD over its recent history.\n Well two things are very quickly apparent\n  There is a significant number of gaps in the data provided to quandl by BitcoinLocal that may influence the significance of the result.\n  The price movements are not one for one for the two currencies creating in theory arbitrage opportunities.\n  This means in theory we could buy use NZD to buy BTC transfer into GBP wallet then use a service like coinbase to \u0026ldquo;cash out\u0026rdquo; and use a regular currency transfer service like Azamo to then transfer back into NZD.\n  Here we can see the historic NZD/GBP exchange sourced from the BOE dataset on quandl against the daily BTCExchange understood as the price in BTC GBP vs BTC NZD.\n  The Details So about now you realize that if it was this easy to do it the arbitrage opportunities would shut the door and fees decimate your returns. Well that is true but not entirely assuming the formula below.\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{X}{(XE - F_t)} (XE_{BTC}-F_{BTC}) (XE_{MT}) - X $$\nWhere profit is the amount invested X divided by the exchange less fees where the fees $F_t$ and $F_{ETC}$ are the unknown. The above chart is a visual representation of when you have the opportunity for arbitrage by trading NZD.\nTaking a practical approach assuming fees are no more than 1% per transaction how much could have been made on the 8th of November per transaction completed transaction. Using the current Azimo transfer as $XE_{MT}$\n$$ $39.88 = \\frac{$100}{((1.8925) (.99))} ((1.3083)(.99))(1.982) - $100 $$\nThis shows with a $100 investment each completed move from NZD to NZD via currency exchange in BTC would have returned a 39.88% return.\nSo what now? How much are fees? How many trades can I make? How much can I make? All goood questions I don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer to. This requires a better dataset than I currently have access to. The point remains that in theory day trading currencies using BTC could be very lucrative.\n","permalink":"http://ezekiel.nz/post/using-btc-exchange-to-find-currency-arbitrage/","summary":"Bitcoin cryptocurrency is treated as both a currency and more and more an asset that is exchanged across multiple FX across the globe.

I produced a series of interactive graphics to examine the outcome of Christchurch\u0026rsquo;s current and past three election cycles. The analysis was built using data sourced from data.govt.nz and elections.org.nz. The boundries of some of the Christchurch electorates reach beyond the city limits but for the sake of this assessment the electorates were kept as a whole.\nA bit of quick background - New Zealand has 120(most of the time) sitting members of parliment with 64 general electorate seats (63 in 2008 and 2011) and 7 Maori electorate seats. This leaves a total of 49 seats to be allocated proportionally by the party vote once the allocation of electorate seats is accounted for. A good breakdown of the New Zealand electoral seats can be found in Spinoffs Article here.\nWithin Christchurch there are 7 electorates so the residents elect 7 MP\u0026rsquo;s. Christchurch\u0026rsquo;s enrolled population within these electoral districts represents roughly 10.5% of the NZ enrolled population. Bluntly speaking this means Christchurch in affect elects another 5 MP\u0026rsquo;s from the party list. In reality it\u0026rsquo;s not that simple but the real affect is so minor it will not be elaborated on here (yet).\nAll the graphs are interactive and you can take off any of the parties/year by using clicking the relevant parties/year.\n ##Election Graphs\n Looking at the party vote in Christchurch grouping the dataset by year and party. This graph shows Christchurch is a land of the major parties with National, Labour, Greens and NZ First taking up the lions share of the vote. Between 2008 and 2011 we see the most dramatic shift from Labour to National while Greens and NZF continue to make ground into 2014. The minor parties show Act has become all but irrelavant since 2008\u0026rsquo;s high.\n Grouped by year and electorate this graph shows the winning candidate of each electorate along with the margin of victory by votes. Notice Selywn and Christchurch East are pretty safe seats while the Waimakariri, Christchuch Central and Port Hills are all up for grabs. In 2011 Christchurch Central was decided by only 47 votes.\n ##Christchurch Region Shiny App Two shapefiles stats.nz\u0026rsquo;s NZ electorate maps and LINZ\u0026rsquo;s urban area maps were combined using ARC before being read into R. The Shiny app displays an interactive visualisation for Electorate and Party votes over the previous three elections.\n  ##Christchurch Demographics\nAll these assessments seem pretty straight forward but what about the 5% party vote threshold affecting the relevent party vote? And does New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s younger demographic and better enrollment impact the outcome?\nMaybe. I ran out of time to get this put together before the election so below you can see Christchurch vs NZ age distribution for both enrolled and represented voters. It shows Christchurch has a higher electorate turnout and a younger distribution than the general NZ population. This graph also demonstrates how impactful the unenrolled 18-24 group has on distorting the age demographic in New Zealand.\n ","permalink":"http://ezekiel.nz/post/christchurch-election/","summary":"Christchurch is New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s second largest city and in the 2017 election cycle it was a key prize for any of the political parties.
