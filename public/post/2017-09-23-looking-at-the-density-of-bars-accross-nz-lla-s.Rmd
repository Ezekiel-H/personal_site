In New Zealand to distribute alcohol you need to apply to your regional LLA liqour licence authority for a permit. The NZ justice department produces a list of all liqour licences distributed in a single year. 


I made this shiny app with the data set from NZ Justice Department and a shapefile/population statistics from stats NZ to show how many people each bar, club and liqour retailer have if we evenly split them up. This is what I like to think of as bars per capita for NZ.

Further work planned on this app is to add a drill down function regional statistics and to accont for age with the R18 drinking age.
