My name is Ezekiel and I am an analyst and on the way from Christchurch, New Zealand to London. I created this website using Hugo to show a bit about what I can and like to do. 


I am interested in data analysis, develelopment in R and Python, big data and Machine learning, I love history and politics and can't say no to a good craft beer. 

I am avaliable to do pro bono work on open source or charitable projects especially focused on sustainability and enviromental causes. Here is a quick snap shot about me, as you can see my CV is also avaliable.
