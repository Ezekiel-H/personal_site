My name is Ezekiel and I am an analyst from New Zealand based in Amsterdam. I am interested in data analysis, development in R and Python, big data and Machine learning, I love history and politics and the enviroment. 

I am excited to learn how I can help with charitable or open source projects especially focused on sustainability and enviromental causes.
