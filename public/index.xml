      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

      <title>Using BTC exchange to find currency arbitrage</title>

      <description>Bitcoin cryptocurrency is treated as both a currency and more and more an asset that is exchanged across multiple FX accross the globe. This presents an interesting question does the market balance the FX accross currencies in real time? If not there would be room for arbitrage and a real ability to make money transfering between currencies using BTC markets.
This quick analysis will look to see if it is theoreticly possible to make money changing NZD for BTC then to GBP and back to NZD via a BTC exchange.</description>

      <title>Bars per capita in NZ</title>

      <description>In New Zealand to distribute alcohol you need to apply to your regional Liqour Licence Authority (LLA) for a permit. The NZ Justice Department produces a list of all liqour licences distributed in a single year.
I made this shiny app using a data set from NZ Justice Department and a shapefile/population statistics from Statistics to show for each LLA how many persons per bar, club or liqour retailer. This can be understood as bars per capita for NZ grouped by LLA’s.</description>

      <description>THIS WILL BE UPDATED WITH 2017 RESULTS ONCE SPECIAL VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED EXPECTED 8TH OCTChristchurch is New Zealand’s second largest city and in the 2017 election cycle it was a key prize for any of the political parties. I produced a series of interactive graphics to examine the outcome of Christchurch’s current and past three election cycles. The analysis was built using data sourced from data.govt.nz and elections.org.nz. The boundries of some of the Christchurch electorates reach beyond the city limits but for the sake of this assessment the electorates were kept as a whole.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
