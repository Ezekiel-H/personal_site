[{"content":"When I can I try to use R so when looking to put a personal site together a few years back I thought it was a good time to explore the blogdown package. Using this I was able to build and maintain the site using mostly R, GIT and a good grasp of how to google css/html.\nI thought I would detail a step by step how to follow this to create a barebones copy and how to host it (for free) on GITHUB\u0026rsquo;s pages\nWhy do this So couple things firstly why? In the modern age an online presence is more of a conclusion than an option so it\u0026rsquo;s importanat to control the narrative. Sure you can use Medium or LinkdIn or an off the shelf website build but fuck that, thats lame.\nA second consideration is why GIT and blogdown, well first off its free and secondly the blogdown structure is designed mobile first, SEO optimised and with the option to write in RMD lets you move seamlessly between code (Not just R) and text. I personally enjoy playing with data and code and R is my first love so to speak so its nice to combine the two.\nDisclamir If you are happy to work it out for yourself there is a very detailed guide in the docs https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html\nOverview  This guide will show step by step how to set up a blogdown site on GIT. Setting up R Setting up GIT Picking a theme Local to Production cycle  Setting up R My folder path is ~R/ so creating a new folder example_ezekiel.nz on ~/R/example_ezekiel.nz and creating a fresh project in the folder, R and install the packages blogdown.\ninstall.packages('blogdown')\rTo quote Yihis \u0026lsquo;Since blogdown is based on the static site generator Hugo (https://gohugo.io), you also need to install Hugo. There is a helper function in blogdown to download and install it automatically on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux):'\nblogdown::install_hugo()\rThen simply\nblogdown::new_site()\rIf you are getting an error check that your wd is on your folder path in my example ~R/example_ezekiel.nz/ and that the folder is empty.\nsetwd(\u0026quot;C:/Users/Ezekiel/Desktop/R/example_ezekiel.nz/\u0026quot;)\rI was getting some wild errors turns out that my R was still on version 3.30 and some packages were failing. Guess 2016 is too long between personal package updates.\nAssuming its all ok you should get the following\n\u0026gt; Want to serve and preview the site now?

This presents an interesting question does the market balance the FX accross currencies in real time? If not there would be room for arbitrage and a real ability to make money transfering between currencies using BTC markets.\nThis quick analysis will look to see if it is theoreticly possible to make money changing NZD for BTC then to GBP and back to NZD via a BTC exchange. Firstly lets look at the price of bitcoin relative to GBP and NZD over its recent history.\n\rWell two things are very quickly apparent\n  There is a significant number of gaps in the data provided to quandl by BitcoinLocal that may influence the significance of the result.\n  The price movements are not one for one for the two currencies creating in theory arbitrage opportunities.\n  This means in theory we could buy use NZD to buy BTC transfer into GBP wallet then use a service like coinbase to \u0026ldquo;cash out\u0026rdquo; and use a regular currency transfer service like Azamo to then transfer back into NZD.\n \rHere we can see the historic NZD/GBP exchange sourced from the BOE dataset on quandl against the daily BTCExchange understood as the price in BTC GBP vs BTC NZD.\n A simple model of when to buy BTC in NZD and when to buy in GBP based on the .05% transfer cost of bitcoin.\n\rThe Details So about now you realize that if it was this easy to do it the arbitrage opportunites would shut the door and fees decimate your returns. Well that is true but not entirely assuming the formula below.\n$$ \\Pi = \\frac{X}{(XE - F_t)} (XE_{BTC}-F_{BTC}) (XE_{MT}) - X $$\nWhere profit is the amount invested X divided by the exchange less fees where the fees $F_t$ and $F_{ETC}$ are the unknown. The above chart is a visual representation of when you have the opportunity for arbitrage by trading NZD.\nTaking a practical approach assuming fees are no more than 1% per transaction how much could have been made on the 8th of November per transaction completed transaction. Using the current Azimo transfer as $XE_{MT}$\n$$ $39.88 = \\frac{$100}{((1.8925) (.99))} ((1.3083)(.99))(1.982) - $100 $$\nThis shows with a $100 investment each completed move from NZD to NZD via currency exchange in BTC would have returned a 39.88% return.\nSo what now? How much are fees? How many trades can I make? How much can I make? All goood questions I don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer to. This requires a better dataset than I currently have access to. The point remains that in theory day trading currencies using BTC could be very lucrative.\n","permalink":"http://ezekiel.nz/post/using-btc-exchange-to-find-currency-arbitrage/","summary":"Bitcoin cryptocurrency is treated as both a currency and more and more an asset that is exchanged across multiple FX accross the globe.

I produced a series of interactive graphics to examine the outcome of Christchurch\u0026rsquo;s current and past three election cycles. The analysis was built using data sourced from data.govt.nz and elections.org.nz. The boundries of some of the Christchurch electorates reach beyond the city limits but for the sake of this assessment the electorates were kept as a whole.\nA bit of quick background - New Zealand has 120(most of the time) sitting members of parliment with 64 general electorate seats (63 in 2008 and 2011) and 7 Maori electorate seats. This leaves a total of 49 seats to be allocated proportionally by the party vote once the allocation of electorate seats is accounted for. A good breakdown of the New Zealand electoral seats can be found in Spinoffs Article here.\nWithin Christchurch there are 7 electorates so the residents elect 7 MP\u0026rsquo;s. Christchurch\u0026rsquo;s enrolled population within these electoral districts represents roughly 10.5% of the NZ enrolled population. Bluntly speaking this means Christchurch in affect elects another 5 MP\u0026rsquo;s from the party list. In reality it\u0026rsquo;s not that simple but the real affect is so minor it will not be elaborated on here (yet).\nAll the graphs are interactive and you can take off any of the parties/year by using clicking the relevant parties/year.\n ##Election Graphs\n\rLooking at the party vote in Christchurch grouping the dataset by year and party. This graph shows Christchurch is a land of the major parties with National, Labour, Greens and NZ First taking up the lions share of the vote. Between 2008 and 2011 we see the most dramatic shift from Labour to National while Greens and NZF continue to make ground into 2014. The minor parties show Act has become all but irrelavant since 2008\u0026rsquo;s high.\n\rGrouped by year and electorate this graph shows the winning candidate of each electorate along with the margin of victory by votes. Notice Selywn and Christchurch East are pretty safe seats while the Waimakariri, Christchuch Central and Port Hills are all up for grabs. In 2011 Christchurch Central was decided by only 47 votes.\n\r##Christchurch Region Shiny App Two shapefiles stats.nz\u0026rsquo;s NZ electorate maps and LINZ\u0026rsquo;s urban area maps were combined using ARC before being read into R. The Shiny app displays an interactive visualisation for Electorate and Party votes over the previous three elections.\n\r\r##Christchurch Demographics\nAll these assessments seem pretty straight forward but what about the 5% party vote threshold affecting the relevent party vote? And does New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s younger demographic and better enrollment impact the outcome?\nMaybe. I ran out of time to get this put together before the election so below you can see Christchurch vs NZ age distribution for both enrolled and represented voters. It shows Christchurch has a higher electorate turnout and a younger distribution than the general NZ population. This graph also demonstrates how impactful the unenrolled 18-24 group has on distorting the age demographic in New Zealand.\n\r","permalink":"http://ezekiel.nz/post/christchurch-election/","summary":"###THIS WILL BE UPDATED WITH 2017 RESULTS ONCE SPECIAL VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED EXPECTED 8TH OCT\nChristchurch is New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s second largest city and in the 2017 election cycle it was a key prize for any of the political parties.
