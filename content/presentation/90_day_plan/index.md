Thinking on Transpowers ambitions to build out its data function from a place the question on  how would I approach the first 90 days?

Leaning on the overall mission of the data function at Transpower which can be summarized succinctly as **"Enhancing decision making"** and taking assumptions from previous conversations I feel as I have a good understanding of what the organization wants to be in 3 years time. 

- Self servicing

- Automated tests, alerting, pipelines and deployments

- Predictive analytics

- Data as a service 

- Integration of DevOps as a practice

In 90 days in a new role in a new team how can we deliver success?

## **Building foundations while delivering milestone achievements**

Taking predictive analytics as an example: 
- To have predictive analytics we need to have a prediction model serving production data
  - In order to have that we need to have the framework for production deployment 
    - In order to have that we need to have consistent data and tooling to unlock the ability of individuals to work as a team
    
So a foundations building block is providing a consistent working environment that is industry standard, unblocking the analytics function. **This is a juypter server.** It does not give us predictive analytics but a milestone achievement and foundation block.

## **Prioritization framework**

So considering the above how should we define what can and should be achieved by this role in the 90 day time frame. Leveraging a simple Effort vs Impact quadrant the 90 plan focuses on quick wins and laying foundations for strategic innovation.

## **90 days into 6 cycles**

Splitting out the 90 days into three key focus areas:


- GIT and workflows
- Data and tooling
- Stakeholder engagement


We are aiming to achieve milestones of 
- Sprint cycles
- Deployment and production tests
- Code review
- Jupyter application for analytics
- Data pipelines alerting and monitoring
