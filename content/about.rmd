My name is Ezekiel but I also go by Zeke. I am 26 years of age, an analyst and on the way from Christchurch, New Zealand to London. I created this website using Hugo to show a bit about what I can and like to do. 


I am interested in development using R and Python, I love history and politics and can't say no to a good craft beer. I am open to work on open source or charitable projects especially focused on sustainability and enviromental causes. Here is a quick snap shot about me, as you can see my CV is also avaliable.  



```{r, include=FALSE}

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addMarkers(lat=51.507351, lng=-0.127758, popup="Zekes in London")
