<p>My name is Ezekiel but I also go by Zeke. I am 26 years of age, an analyst and on the way from Christchurch, New Zealand to London. I created this website using Hugo to show a bit about what I can and like to do.</p>
<p>I am interested in development using R and Python, I love history and politics and canâ€™t say no to a good craft beer. I am open to work on open source or charitable projects especially focused on sustainability and enviromental causes. Here is a quick snap shot about me, as you can see my CV is also avaliable.</p>
