<p>My name is Ezekiel but I also go by Zeke I am a 26 year old analyst on the way from Christchurch New Zealand headed to London. I created this website using Hugo to show a bit about what I can and like to do.</p>
<p>I am interested in development using R and Python, I love history and politics and canâ€™t say no to a good craft beer. I am open to work on open source or charitable projects especially focused on sustainability and enviromental protection just get in touch. Here is a quick snap shot about me as you can see my CV is also avaliable.</p>
